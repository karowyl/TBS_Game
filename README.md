# Karol_TBS

The design is meant to be a simple game of TBS. The graphics is from the console. The main 
aim of the player is to kill the opponent. A problem is to fit in the specific period of time. At 
the beginning of the game, the player has to create armies, that will enable him to kill the 
enemy. The army can consist of matchlocks, pikes, sword, archers and cavalry. Money also 
plays an important role because the player constantly has to keep attention on his income and 
upkeep cost. If the gamer stops earning and his income is negative, he loses the game.
However, the player is able to earn money by building crops farm, stables or market. If the 
player does not kill the opponent, e.g. within 50 rounds, he loses.
